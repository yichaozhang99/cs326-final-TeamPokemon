**A brief and precise representation of APIs for you application:**

POST /getInfo
body: {pokemonName: string}
=> Promise<pokemonEntry|{error:string}>
  
  
GET /getHistory
 => Promise(<pokemonEntry[]>)
 
 
POST /debugGetEntry (For Testing since it doesnâ€™t add data to the database)
body: {pokemonName: string}
=> Promise<pokemonEntry|{error:string}>


GET /
	=> index.html
  
  
GET /recuits
=> Recruits.html


GET /dashboard
=> dashboard.html

We created the ability to Update and Delete, but do not find them necessary for the purposes of our application.

**At least one set of four screenshots of your client interface with descriptions**

This image is the main page where the client will type in the pokemon they are looking to find. Once they search it will create the pokemon in our database which will be later grabbed when opening the history page. In addition, it will open the dash for that pokemon.

This is the geodude dashboard that will load. It will have a variety of characteristics listed on the side as well as recruits which are good pokemon to defeat it. Each recruit will have the option to click it which will save that pokemon to the database for later view in the history as well as open up the dash for the pokemon. 

<img src="https://github.com/RyanHCoulter/cs326-final-TeamPokemon/blob/main/docs/mankey.png"/>

For exmaple, if mankey was clicked, this would load and the mankey dash and have the same options as before with geodude but now with mankey. 

<img src="https://github.com/RyanHCoulter/cs326-final-TeamPokemon/blob/main/docs/history-tab.png"/>

This is the history page which pulls the previous pokemon that have been viewed and displays them in a table with a brief overlay of the information from the dash as well as the option to open the dash again. 

**Database**

imageUrl varchar(100),
type varchar(100),
name varchar(100),
location varchar(100),
abilities varchar(100),
evolution varchar(100),e
nemies varchar(100),
primary key(name))"

Information stored in our database. We can add pokemon by name. Delete pokemon by name. Update a pokemon entry. Lastly it can be called to return the last 10 (or less) entries which will be shown in the history tab.

Frontend Ryan:
	Fetch calls as necessary: (new file)
		Post on mainpage
		Get when going to history page
		Post from history to dash on entry click
		Post on enemy click (dash page)

Server DB Calls Yichao:
	addPokemon(pokemonEntry)=>Promise<boolean>
	getPokemon(pokemonName)=>Promise<pokemonEntry|null>
	getRecents()=>Promise<pokemonEntry[]>(ordered descending orderAdded max10)
	docs/setup.md

Server Kobi:
	Setup express and call above functions as needed,
	Get info from pokeApi if not already available
